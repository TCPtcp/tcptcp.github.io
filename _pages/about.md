# 📝 Projects

🎉🎉 *2024.04-2024.06*: &nbsp;  *Project Name:*  **PTSD Risk Assessment for Rescue Workers Based on Multimodal Fusion.**

- This project primarily focuses on the early screening and intervention of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among rescue personnel. Initially, 
data preprocessing and **feature engineering** were conducted on questionnaire data to identify variables associated with the likelihood of developing PTSD,
transforming the problem into a binary classification task.

- To address the issues of data label **imbalance** and **high dimensionality**, SMOTE was applied to the training set for oversampling, and a **Lasso-Logistic
model** was constructed for variable selection and classification prediction. Subsequently, integrating questionnaire data with EEG data, a mid-level
**fusion model** (MLP+GRU+DNN+Logistic) was employed to model the risk of occurrence.

🎉🎉 *2024.05-2024.10*: &nbsp;  *Project Name:*  **Kaggle RSNA 2024 Lumbar Degenerative Classification.**
- For the provided lumbar MRI data, the required data was extracted through data transformation and data splitting. Additionally, **data augmentation** was performed
on the training data using methods such as **Gaussian blur**, brightness and contrast adjustment, and **translation, rotation, and scaling**. The MRI images were classified
and trained based on a **pre-trained EfficientNet model**, and the final model achieved a **score of 0.80** on a non-public dataset.


🎉🎉 *2022.10-2023.06*: &nbsp;  *Project Name:*  **Research on Comprehensive Evaluation Model of Intelligent Transportation Based on Vehicular Network Big Data.**

- The project is based on the in-vehicle data of freight vehicles to analyze the driving behavior of drivers. First, the obtained vehicular network data
is preprocessed and **feature extraction** is performed to obtain driving behavior indicators.

- In the analysis of driving behavior, **DBSCAN density clustering** is used to cluster the driving behavior indicator data, categorizing driving behavior into
three classes and obtaining data labels. Based on these clustered data labels, **ensemble learning** is applied, combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost to
classify and predict driving behavior. Finally, a driving behavior visualization dashboard is built using **ECharts**.

🎉🎉 *2021.10-2022.06*: &nbsp;  *Project Name:*  **Application of Machine Learning Methods in the Statistical Analysis of Digital Economy in Shanxi.**
- The project was a research topic approved for the 2023 Shanxi Provincial Social and Economic Statistics Research Program. As the leader of the student team,
  I fully participated in the project's topic selection, proposal writing, and finalization under the guidance of a faculty advisor.

- Based on data related to the digital economy in Shanxi Province, the project constructed an evaluation system for the development level of the digital economy 
using the entropy weight method. It analyzed the current status of the digital economy in Shanxi and used **Ridge regression** and **Random Forest models** to analyze the 
influencing factors. Additionally, a visualization app was created using **R Shiny**.
